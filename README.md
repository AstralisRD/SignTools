## Introduction

SignTools is a sideloading platform that takes a different approach from any similar tools. It consists of two components â€” a **service** and a **builder**. The builder is a macOS machine which performs signing using official Apple software. Doing so means high reliability and compatibility. The service (this repo) can be hosted anywhere, and it provides a web interface for you to upload, sign, and download apps, using the builder where necessary. Having the web service means that you don't need anything installed on your phone, and you can still sideload without a computer.

## Note on free developer accounts

Starting from SignTools 3.0.0, free developer accounts are no longer supported. Most of SignTools' unique features have always required a paid account, and using the project with a free account has always been unnecessarily more difficult than other freely available tools. Additionally, certain suboptimal design choices were made to accommodate for free accounts, which reduced stability and performance. Therefore, with this new release, the signing flow has been significantly reworked and should be much faster and more robust.
