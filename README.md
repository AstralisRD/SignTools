# iOS Signer Service

## Introduction

There are many reasons to install apps outside Apple's App Store. Unfortunately, this process is severely hindered by Apple and unrealistic for the average user. You need a better way to get things done.

Introducing `ios-signer-service` - a self-hosted, cross-platform service to sign and install iOS apps, all **without a computer**.

What's the catch? The workflow uses a separate macOS machine, called a "builder", to perform the signing. This project is only a web service which controls the builder, along with a nice web interface for you to upload unsigned apps and download signed apps. However, **you don't need to own a Mac** - the builder can be any free CI (Continuous Integration) provider or your own machine. The web service can be hosted on any computer or **even your phone**.

More information and examples can be found in the installation section.

## Disclaimer

This project is self-hosted; there is no public service. It does not provide any alternative catalog of apps. It does not give you free signing certificates, or circumvent any protective measures - **you must have a valid signing certificate and provisioning profile**. This project does not provide, promote, or support any form of piracy. This project is aimed solely at people who want to install homebrew apps on their device, much like the popular [AltStore](https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore).
